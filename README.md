# TCP-Receiver
The overall objective of this assignment is to help you build and understand the working of a
TCP receiver. The assignment is decomposed into three primary components:
 1. Building the ByteStream class.
 2. Building a reassembler to assemble back the segments received from the sender in the correct order.
 3. Building the actual TCP receiver by stitching together the ByteStream and Reassembler.
